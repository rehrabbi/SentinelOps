## 1. How to resume on a new device

1. Clone the repo and open the folder in VSCode.
2. Tell Claude: *"Read docs/WAYS-OF-WORKING.md and docs/PROJECT-STATE.md, then re-orient
   per the Session behavior section and continue."* (Re-paste the operating manual too if
   you have it — but WAYS-OF-WORKING.md captures all of it.)
3. Claude should summarize state, confirm the next step below, and wait for your go-ahead.
4. **Prerequisites on the new device:** a container runtime, Go 1.26+, Node.js + npm, git.
   Recreate the git-ignored root `.env` (see `.env.example`) — it holds the Postgres
   credentials (never committed). Platform-specific setup is in §9.

> **Note:** Claude's saved "memory" is per-device and does NOT travel. All rules/prefs
> are captured in `docs/WAYS-OF-WORKING.md` instead — that file is authoritative.

## 2. What SentinelOps is

A production-style, cloud-native SaaS: a **secure incident & ticket management
platform**. The learning objective is the **engineering around the app** (security,
cloud, DevSecOps, IaC, observability), not just CRUD. Target architecture: CDN/WAF →
LB → Dockerized frontend+backend → Postgres/RDS, with a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
(tests, SAST, dependency/secret/container scanning, Docker build, deploy) provisioning
AWS via Terraform. Everything must be **free**.

---

## 3. Locked stack decisions (all free)

| Area | Decision | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Backend language | **Go** (stdlib `net/http`, no web framework) | Chose Go over "TS everywhere" for cloud-native depth |
| DB access | **`database/sql` + pgx driver**, hand-written SQL, **no ORM** | Learn SQL directly |
| Frontend | **React + Vite + TypeScript** | react-ts template |
| Database | **PostgreSQL 17** in Docker | localhost-only bind |
| Repo | **Monorepo** (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `docs/`), **public** GitHub | keep real email in commits; repo is public, so treat everything pushed as visible to anyone |
| Migrations | **golang-migrate** (as a library, `go:embed` SQL) | explicit `migrate` subcommand |
| Config | 12-factor env vars; git-ignored `.env` + committed `.env.example` | secrets never committed |

---

## 4. Decisions made per stage (chronological)

**Database / users table (migration 000001):** UUID PK (`gen_random_uuid()`),
`timestamptz` timestamps, case-insensitive unique email via `UNIQUE INDEX on
lower(email)`, `password_hash` column, NOT NULL constraints.

**Backend layering:** by-feature packages under `internal/` (Go `internal/` = importable
only within this module). Each domain = model + repository (SQL) + handler (HTTP), wired
by **manual dependency injection** in `main.go`.

**Users read API (`GET /api/users`):** repository omits `password_hash`; `User.PasswordHash`
has `json:"-"`; handler logs real errors but returns generic messages.

**Users write API (`POST /api/users`) — registration:**
- Password hashing: **bcrypt** (`golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt`, cost = DefaultCost/10).
- Validation: **in `internal/user/validate.go`** — valid email (`net/mail`), password
  **min 12 chars, no composition rules** (NIST 800-63B, length > symbols), max 72 bytes.
- Duplicate email: **trust the DB** — INSERT and catch Postgres `23505` → sentinel
  `ErrEmailTaken` → `409` (atomic; avoids TOCTOU race).
- Strict JSON parse: `MaxBytesReader` (1 MiB) + `DisallowUnknownFields` (mass-assignment
  defense) + reject trailing data. Success = `201 Created` + `Location`.

**Authentication — login (complete):**
- Strategy: **server-side sessions** (opaque token in an HttpOnly cookie, session row in
  Postgres) — over JWT / managed provider. Instant revocation; teaches secure cookies + CSRF.
- Token at rest: store **SHA-256 hash** of the token only (fast SHA-256 is fine — token
  is 256-bit random; bcrypt is only for guessable passwords).
- Session lifetime: **7-day absolute expiry**.
- Sessions table (migration 000002): `token_hash` PK, `user_id` FK `ON DELETE CASCADE`,
  `created_at`, `expires_at`; indexes on `user_id` and `expires_at`.
- Login route: **RESTful `POST /api/sessions`** (logout later = `DELETE
  /api/sessions/current`).
- Cookie: `SameSite=Lax` (CSRF defense), `HttpOnly`, `Secure` (env-driven; off for local
  http), 7-day expiry.
- Package structure: **`internal/session`** (data) + **`internal/auth`** (login/logout
  handlers + upcoming middleware). `auth` depends on BOTH `user` and `session`, which is
  exactly why it is its own package — putting login inside either domain would weld the
  two together and risk an import cycle.
- Timing defense: on an unknown email, run a bcrypt compare against a **precomputed dummy
  hash** so "no such user" costs the same as "wrong password" (blocks user enumeration by
  response time). Both paths return an identical `401 invalid email or password`.

**Config & CORS decisions (Step 5):**
- `SECURE_COOKIES` — dedicated boolean env var, **default false** (local dev is plain
  http, where a `Secure` cookie would be silently dropped). Production MUST set it true.
  Chosen over deriving it from an `APP_ENV` because the link from var to behavior is direct.
- `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` — env var, defaults to `http://localhost:5173`. Replaces the hardcoded
  `allowedOrigin` const; matters more now that credentialed CORS is on.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` — required for the browser to store/send the
  session cookie cross-origin (`:5173` → `:8080`). **Never combine with `*`** — browsers
  forbid it, because it would let any site call the API with the victim's cookie.
- **OPTIONS preflight handled in `withCORS`**, returning 204 with `Allow-Methods`,
  `Allow-Headers`, `Max-Age`. Fixed a latent bug: `mux.HandleFunc("POST /api/...")` matches
  only POST, so preflight fell through to 405 and *any* browser JSON POST would have failed
  — including the existing registration endpoint. curl never revealed it (curl doesn't
  preflight; only browsers do).

---

## 5. What's built and working

**Endpoints live:** `GET /healthz` (liveness), `GET /readyz` (DB readiness),
`GET /api/users` (list), `POST /api/users` (register — tested 6/6: 201, dup→409,
short pw→400, bad email→400, unknown field→400, DB shows real `$2a$10$…` bcrypt hash),
**`POST /api/sessions` (login)**, **`GET /api/me`** (current user — protected; tested 7/7),
**`DELETE /api/sessions/current`** (logout — tested 6/6, see the learning log).

**Login test results (8/8 passing):** 200 + `Set-Cookie` on valid credentials; 401 on wrong
password; 401 **byte-identical** on unknown email; 400 on unknown JSON field; `OPTIONS`
preflight → 204 with full CORS headers; session row present with a 64-char hash and 7-day
expiry. Cookie observed as `Path=/; Max-Age=604800; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax` (no `Secure`,
correct for local http). Three security properties verified rather than assumed:
1. No bcrypt hash in the login response body (`json:"-"` holds, on a struct that *did* carry it).
2. Timing indistinguishable — unknown email **51.0ms** vs wrong password **52.0ms** over 5
   runs each (the ~50ms *is* bcrypt cost 10; without the dummy hash the miss would be ~1ms).
3. DB stores `sha256(raw token)`, never the raw token — confirmed by hashing the returned
   cookie locally and comparing. Note both values are 64 hex chars, so length proves nothing.

**Files:**
- `backend/main.go` — routes + CORS middleware + `migrate` subcommand + manual DI.
- `backend/db.go` — `openDB` (sql.Open + pgx, pool tuning).
- `backend/migrate.go` — `go:embed` migrations, `runMigrateUp`.
- `backend/migrations/000001_create_users.{up,down}.sql`
- `backend/migrations/000002_create_sessions.{up,down}.sql` (applied; schema_migrations=2)
- `backend/internal/user/{user.go, repository.go, handler.go, validate.go}` —
  repository includes `GetByEmail` (loads `password_hash`), **`GetByID`** (no `password_hash`),
  `ErrUserNotFound`.
- `backend/internal/session/{session.go, repository.go}` — Session model; `GenerateToken`
  (crypto/rand, 32 bytes), `HashToken` (SHA-256), `Repository.Create`, **`GetByTokenHash`**
  (non-expired lookup, expiry enforced in SQL), **`DeleteByTokenHash`** (idempotent revoke)
  + `ErrSessionNotFound`.
- `backend/internal/auth/handler.go` — **`Login`** + **`Me`** (current user) + **`Logout`**
  (revoke session + expire cookie, idempotent `204`), `NewHandler`, cookie constants, dummy hash.
- `backend/internal/auth/middleware.go` (new) — **`RequireAuth`** (cookie → session → user →
  request context; fail-closed `401` on missing/invalid/expired) + **`UserFromContext`** helper
  using an unexported context-key type.
- `backend/main.go` — now also builds `sessionRepo` + `authHandler`, registers
  `POST /api/sessions`, reads `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`/`SECURE_COOKIES` via `envOr`/`envBool`
  helpers, and `withCORS(next, allowedOrigin)` handles credentials + OPTIONS preflight.
- `frontend/` — React+Vite+TS; `src/App.tsx` fetches `/healthz` (not yet wired to auth).

**Git:** on `main`. Login work (auth package + main.go wiring) and these doc updates are
**uncommitted** as of this snapshot. Last pushed commit: `2e98c88` (README + continuity guides).

**Runtime state:** container `sentinelops-db` (Postgres 17) runs the DB.
⚠️ **Database contents do NOT travel between devices** — `pgdata` is a local Docker volume,
not part of the repo. The Windows box's users (`alice@`/`bob@` with fake hashes,
`carol@example.com`) do **not** exist on other machines. On the Mac the DB was created fresh
and holds one throwaway account, `testuser@example.com` (password
`correct-horse-battery-staple` — disposable local test credential only), plus its sessions.
After cloning anywhere new, register your own test user via `POST /api/users`.

---

## 6. ⏭️ THE EXACT NEXT STEP — wire the frontend auth UI

**The backend auth cycle is COMPLETE and verified: register → login → `/api/me` → logout.**
Login 8/8, middleware + `/api/me` 7/7, logout 6/6 (incl. the key result: the *same* token
returns 401 after logout, the DB row is deleted, and logout with a dead/no cookie is an
idempotent 204). See the learning-log entries for the details.

**Next: the frontend.** Today `frontend/src/App.tsx` only calls `/healthz`. Build the real
auth UX against the now-working API:

```
- a login form (email + password) -> POST /api/sessions
- on load, call GET /api/me to detect an existing session (show the user, else the form)
- a logout button -> DELETE /api/sessions/current
- CRITICAL: every API fetch must set `credentials: "include"`, or the browser will neither
  store nor send the session cookie across origins (:5173 -> :8080).
```

**Files this will touch** (taught interactively, small pieces):
| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src/` | an auth API helper (fetch wrappers that send credentials) |
| `frontend/src/App.tsx` | login form / logged-in view / logout, with loading + error states |

**Decisions to make first** (decision protocol): how to hold auth state in React (local state
vs context), where the API base URL comes from (Vite env var vs hardcoded), and the login
form's loading/error UX. We'll cover these before any code.

**Security to revisit here:** the account-enumeration inconsistency (login is timing-safe but
registration still returns a distinguishing 409), and XSS discipline on the frontend (React
escapes by default — never introduce `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with server data).

**After that:** authorization/RBAC, then the incident/ticket features.


## 7. After login: remaining auth pieces, then roadmap

Immediate next: **wire the frontend** login/logout UI against the finished auth API. (Backend
auth — register / login / logout / route-protection middleware — is done and verified; see §6.)

Then the broader roadmap (guide, not auto-permission): authorization/RBAC → incident
features → file/evidence handling → audit logging → security hardening → automated tests
→ Docker for the app → CI → security scanning → AWS architecture → Terraform →
deployment → CDN/WAF/TLS → monitoring/alerts → attack testing → reliability/backup →
cost/perf review → production hardening → documentation/portfolio review.

## 8. How to run locally (quick reference)

```bash
# 0) macOS only: start the container VM first (see §9)
colima start

# 1) Start Postgres
docker compose up -d

# 2) Build DATABASE_URL from .env WITHOUT printing the password, then migrate (from backend/)
set -a; . ../.env; set +a
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@127.0.0.1:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}?sslmode=disable"
go run . migrate

# 3) Run the API (same shell, same DATABASE_URL)
go run .

# 4) Run the frontend
cd ../frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Optional env vars (both have working local defaults, so no `.env` change is needed):
`FRONTEND_ORIGIN` (default `http://localhost:5173`) and `SECURE_COOKIES` (default `false`;
**must be `true` in production**, or the session cookie travels in cleartext).

## 9. Per-device environment notes

**Windows:** Go lives at `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Programs\Go` (portable ZIP, no
admin). PowerShell subprocess PATH can be stale — refresh from Machine+User env, or prepend
`.../Go/bin` to PATH in the shell.

**macOS (Apple Silicon) — set up 2026-08-16:**
- Toolchain via Homebrew: `brew install go colima docker docker-compose node`.
  Homebrew installs to `/opt/homebrew` and writes `/etc/paths.d/homebrew`, so **a new
  terminal tab** picks it up; an already-open shell keeps its stale PATH (`command not
  found: docker` is almost always this, not a broken install).
- **Colima instead of Docker Desktop** — free with no licensing conditions at any company
  size (Docker Desktop requires a paid licence above 250 employees / $10M revenue).
  Colima provides the Linux VM; the `docker` CLI and compose plugin are separate packages.
  `compose.yaml` needs no changes. Start it with `colima start` before `docker compose`.
- **`docker compose` needs one-time wiring.** Homebrew puts the plugin somewhere the CLI
  doesn't search, so `docker: unknown command: docker compose` until `~/.docker/config.json`
  contains:
  ```json
  { "cliPluginsExtraDirs": ["/opt/homebrew/lib/docker/cli-plugins"] }
  ```
- Verified working: Go 1.26.6 (go.mod needs 1.26.5), Colima 0.10.3, docker 29.7.2,
  compose 5.4.0, Node 26.7.0.
- **Git identity does not survive a clone.** Set it before committing on a new machine:
  `git config --global user.name "..."` and `git config --global user.email "..."`.
